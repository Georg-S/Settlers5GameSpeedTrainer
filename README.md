# Settlers-5: Heritage of Kings Game Speed Trainer

With this trainer, you can increase the game speed for Settlers-5 up to 10 times the normal speed.

I tested and used it with the Windows 10 executable for Settlers-5 (`settlershok_w10cu.exe`). With this executable, it works with the base game as well as with both addons.
*Note: It probably does not work with other executables or platforms.*

### Keybinds:
- **F9**: Resume normal game speed (1.0)
- **F10**: Set game speed to 2.0
- **F11**: Set game speed to 5.0
- **F12**: Set game speed to 10.0

### How-to:
1. Start the speed-trainer-application.
2. Start Settlers-5.
3. In-game, you should now be able to increase/decrease the game speed using the F9-F12 keys.
